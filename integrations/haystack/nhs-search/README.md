# Doc Search App [Pinecone x Streamlit]

## Ideas

* Doc search app
* Using scraped technical docs from Streamlit
* Could be cool to add technical docs from other places \[HuggingFace, Pinecone\]?
* * With additional docs, we could show off metadata filtering
* UI nice simple search bar, metadata filtering could be dropdown/checkboxes, or a recommendation after performing a search that returns mostly docs from one of the sections
* Q&A style search would be best, if not possible a vanilla semantic search, which we could fine-tune easily w/ TSDAE if performance is not optimal
